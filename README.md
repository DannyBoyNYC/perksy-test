# Gift Cards

Bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Yarn and run!

## Master branch
* preview on Netlify https://vigilant-allen-070be9.netlify.com/
* uses Styled Components and a mix of class and functional components with hooks
* add a few items to the cart and toggle the cart icon at the top left
* toggle Sort by Quantity to sort without mutation

## sortable branch
* preview on Netlify https://silly-neumann-73e761.netlify.com/
* when I finished the master branch I realized it didn't have one of the requested features 
* it was too time consuming to refactor everything in under 2 hours so so I created this
* with a bit of additional time I can integrate it into the main branch - happy to do so if it makes a difference
* wasn't quite certain about the instructions 'View all items sorted by type and price' so I threw in a few additional sorts

Due to time constraints all the usual caveats around this not being polished apply. 

Let me know what you think!
